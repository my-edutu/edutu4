## üü° Minor Issues Identified

### 1. Testing Infrastructure
**Issue**: No testing framework currently configured  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Recommendation**: Set up Vitest + React Testing Library  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

### 2. Bundle Size Optimization
**Issue**: Lucide React icons could be tree-shaken better  
**Impact**: Low  
**Recommendation**: Import specific icons instead of entire library  
**Effort**: 1 hour  
```typescript
// Instead of: import { Icon } from 'lucide-react'
// Use: import Icon from 'lucide-react/dist/esm/icons/icon'
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring
**Issue**: No real-time performance tracking in production  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Recommendation**: Integrate Web Vitals monitoring  
**Effort**: 2 hours  
```bash
npm install web-vitals
```

### 4. SEO Optimization
**Issue**: Limited meta tags and structured data  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive SEO meta tags  
**Effort**: 3 hours  

### 5. Image Optimization
**Issue**: Images not optimized for different screen densities  
**Impact**: Low  
**Recommendation**: Implement responsive images with srcSet  
**Effort**: 2 hours
